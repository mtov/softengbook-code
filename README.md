# Software Engineering: A Modern Approach - Code Examples

Source code examples from the book [Software Engineering: A Modern Approach](https://softengbook.org/).

* [Chapter 6](https://github.com/mtov/softengbook-code/tree/main/ch6) - Design patterns examples

## How to run the examples?

### Java

Most examples are implemented in Java. Therefore, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

* A Java distribution, such as [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), a dependency manager

To check whether both are correctly installed, run:

`java -version`

`mvn -v`
